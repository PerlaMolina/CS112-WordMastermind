I looked up the indexOf() method through the Java API website.

I asked a classmate how to easily repeat the game if the player wants to play again.

I had trouble with double letters that the player guesses and only counting it once. I figured out a way that fixes it, but it causes 
certain errors with certain words so it didn't work out well. I didn't leave it in the program, but it is in a comment on line 61, just 
in case the grader wants to look at it and give me any feedback on how to fix this.
